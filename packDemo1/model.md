# About

MobileNet V2 is a lightweight, efficient convolutional neural network architecture designed primarily for on-device and mobile vision applications (e.g., image classification and object detection). It was introduced by Google in the paper *“MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks.”* Its key features include:

1. **Inverted Residual Blocks**  
   Instead of the traditional approach of expanding channels and then reducing them, MobileNet V2’s building blocks start with a lower-dimensional set of feature maps, apply depthwise separable convolutions in an expanded (higher-dimensional) space, and then project back down to a lower-dimensional space. This is referred to as an *inverted residual* structure because it inverts the original “bottleneck” design found in many modern CNNs.

2. **Linear Bottlenecks**  
   To minimize loss of information, MobileNet V2 uses a linear bottleneck layer after expansion. This helps preserve representational power while keeping the network capacity small.

3. **Efficiency and Speed**  
   MobileNet V2 is optimized for devices with limited computational resources, such as smartphones and embedded devices. It achieves a good balance of accuracy and efficiency through:
   - Depthwise separable convolutions (breaking down a standard convolution into a depthwise and pointwise convolution)
   - Reduced parameter count
   - Low latency suitable for real-time applications

4. **Good Accuracy vs. Size Trade-off**  
   Despite its compact size, MobileNet V2 can achieve competitive accuracy on image classification benchmarks (like ImageNet) compared to larger architectures.

5. **Common Uses**  
   - Image classification on smartphones and edge devices  
   - Object detection (often used as a backbone in larger detection frameworks)  
   - Feature extraction backbone in tasks like semantic segmentation and keypoint detection  

Overall, MobileNet V2 is a popular choice when you need a fast, lightweight neural network for vision tasks on devices with constrained compute and memory resources.
